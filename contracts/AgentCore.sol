/**
 * @title AgentCore
 * @notice A minimal yet powerful “Agent” contract that:
 *         1) Anchors references to its AgentToken (utility-only ERC20).
 *         2) Optionally links to MultiAgentAIDAOReferences for time-stamped #PriorArt (2017).
 *         3) Allows ownership transfer for meta-governance (e.g., from deployer to “Business of AGI”).
 *         4) Demonstrates an upgrade mechanism (event-based, minimal example) for unstoppable on-chain synergy.
 *
 *         By explicitly citing the #PriorArt (2017) “Multi-Agent AI DAO”:
 *         - We ensure ironclad legal coverage against trivial patent claims on multi-agent, on-chain AI synergy.
 *         - We reaffirm unstoppable evolution of AI Agents in line with the original vision from August 8, 2017.
 *
 *         Key Points:
 *         - agentToken: an address pointing to the deployed AgentToken (ERC20).
 *         - references (optional): a pointer to MultiAgentAIDAOReferences for on-chain prior-art info.
 *         - owner: retains meta-level control, can be transferred to a specialized governance contract or a “Business of AGI.”
 *         - Minimal upgrade() example: in a real scenario, a proxy-based approach might be used, but this snippet
 *           highlights unstoppable on-chain synergy with event-based tracking.
