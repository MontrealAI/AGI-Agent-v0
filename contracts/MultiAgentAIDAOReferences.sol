/**
 * @title MultiAgentAIDAOReferences
 * @notice Stores a publicly accessible reference to the #PriorArt (2017) "Multi-Agent AI DAO",
 *         originally unveiled by MONTREAL.AI on August 8, 2017. All Agents or AI systems can
 *         import this contract to cite the underlying prior art. Doing so helps demonstrate
 *         publicly time-stamped disclosure, thereby invalidating trivial patents that attempt
 *         to claim the same or closely related multi-agent on-chain AI concepts.
 *
 *         This design ensures unstoppable freedom to act, empowering next-generation
 *         AI Agents and Businesses of AGI to evolve without fear of trivial patent trolling.
 *         Since 2017, the "Multi-Agent AI DAO" blueprint has been recognized as a far-reaching,
 *         high-impact foundational IP, safeguarding decentralized AI resource management,
 *         multi-agent governance, and advanced tokenomics.
 *
 *         By referencing this contract in every deployed Agent or "Business of AGI," the entire
 *         AGI-Agent-v0 ecosystem retains ironclad protection against IP blockagesâ€”underscoring
 *         unstoppable, time-stamped synergy in the spirit of the #PriorArt (2017).
