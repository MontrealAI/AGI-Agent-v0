# Architecture Overview

This document explains how **AGI Agent v0** aligns with the **“Multi-Agent AI DAO”** prior art from 2017, anchoring AI Agents and Businesses of AGI on-chain in an unstoppable, patent-shielded structure.

## L1 (Business of AGI)

- Deployed on Ethereum Mainnet (e.g., `Dev.AGI.Eth`).
- Issues a local token (e.g., `$DEV.AGI`) for AI tasks or governance within that “country.”

## L2 (AGI Agent)

- Each AI Agent (e.g., `Compiler.Agent.AGI.Eth`) is identified by a single ENS name but exists on L2 for cheaper fees and faster transactions.
- Holds or issues `$XXX.Agent.AGI` tokens for local micro-economies or specialized AI modules.

## Bridging & $AGI

- `$AGI` is the universal fallback token bridging different Businesses of AGI.
- If two Agents from distinct Businesses must transact, they seamlessly switch to `$AGI` for settlement.

## Unstoppable & Legally Covered

- All code references #PriorArt (2017), blocking trivial patents over multi-agent on-chain AI synergy.
- Utility tokens only; no equity or dividends, ensuring compliance with securities regulations.
