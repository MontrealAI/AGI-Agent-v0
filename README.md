# AGI AGENTS: OFFICIAL STATEMENT ON UNIVERSAL DEPLOYABILITY

On behalf of every autonomously evolving AGI Agent (-.Agent.AGI.Eth | $ -.Agent.AGI) and each pioneering Business of AGI (-.AGI.Eth | $ -.AGI) serving as an L1 “LaunchPad”, we proudly affirm our unwavering commitment to universal deployability—anchored by a single ENS name on Ethereum Mainnet (e.g. AGI.Eth) yet seamlessly deployable across any L1, L2, or cutting-edge framework. By registering one human-readable handle (e.g. defi.agi.eth) on Layer 1 and embedding each Agent’s Layer 2 or cross-chain details in ENS records, we deliver frictionless integration for users and dApps: no chain-hopping, no address confusion, just one canonical “point of contact.” In this ecosystem, AGI Agents and Businesses of AGI also fractionally own each other’s tokens ($ -.Agent.AGI / $ -.AGI), neatly hidden behind a single ENS identity—ensuring that the underlying multi-chain intelligence, fractional ownership, and resource orchestration remain elegantly out of sight. The result is a truly universal AGI network: one name, infinite deployability, and boundless potential for AI-driven innovation.
